### 🏨 A Complete Hotel Management Solution

A modern **Full Stack Hotel Management System** built using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **PostgreSQL (Neon Database)**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. The system provides a centralized platform for managing hotel operations, including rooms, reservations, guests, employees, payments, billing, housekeeping, maintenance, and guest services through a responsive web interface and RESTful APIs.

# 📖 Project Description

The **Hotel Management System** is designed to digitize and simplify the daily operations of hotels by replacing manual record keeping with an efficient, cloud-connected management platform. It enables hotel staff and administrators to manage reservations, room availability, guest information, employee records, billing, payments, housekeeping, maintenance, and additional services from a single dashboard.

The backend is developed using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, exposing RESTful APIs that interact with a **Neon PostgreSQL** cloud database for secure and reliable data storage. The frontend is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, offering a clean and interactive user interface for performing CRUD operations and monitoring hotel activities in real time.

The application follows a modular architecture, making it scalable, maintainable, and easy to extend with future enhancements such as authentication, role-based access control, analytics dashboards, online payments, report generation, and email notifications. This project demonstrates practical implementation of full-stack web development, REST API design, cloud database integration, and relational database management.
